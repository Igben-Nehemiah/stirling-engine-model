# Striling engine model

This is a simple repo for testing implementations to be used for my MSC project on "An investigation on anomalous thermal conductivity in Stirling engines".
#TODO
-   Add basic power cycles (Stirling and others)
-   Review nanofluids and their history in thermal conductivity enhancement. This includes describing what models have already been used to approximate their behaviour and critically review their applicability.
-   Add definition for hard-sphere potential
