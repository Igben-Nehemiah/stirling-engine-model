# project-practice

This is a simple repo for testing implementations to be used for my MSC project in Nanofluid for Renewable Energy Generation

#TODO

-   Add basic power cycles (Stirling and others)
-   Review nanofluids and their history in thermal conductivity enhancement. This includes describing what models have already been used to approximate their behaviour and critically review their applicability.
-   Add simple modlecular dynamics simulation with python.
-   Add CFD simulation.
