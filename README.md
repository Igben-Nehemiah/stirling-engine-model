# Stirling Engine Model with Anomalous Thermal Conductivity of Gas Mixtures

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Stirling engine model that investigates the effects of gas mixtures, specifically hydrogen-helium mixtures, on the performance of Stirling engines. The model is developed as part of a study aimed at enhancing renewable energy systems by exploring the use of gas mixtures as working fluids in Stirling engines. The innovation in this study lies in the consideration of the "anomalous" thermal conductivity behavior exhibited by hydrogen-helium mixtures, which can significantly impact the engine's performance.

## Features

-   **Stirling Engine Simulation**: A detailed thermodynamic model that simulates the performance of a Stirling engine under different working conditions.
-   **Gas Mixtures as Working Fluids**: Incorporation of hydrogen-helium mixtures, focusing on their anomalous thermal conductivity properties.
-   **Model Validation**: Validation of the model against existing data, including the use of Enskog theory to predict thermophysical properties of the gas mixtures.
-   **Visualisation**: Generation of figures to visualise the thermal conductivity effects and engine performance.
